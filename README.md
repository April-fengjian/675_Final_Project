How to Run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SYDE675_Project_Code.ipynb need to run with the original code at https://github.com/ShawnXYang/TIP-IM
The default model using to produce the mask is ArcFace model, it can be change in the main function.
The default model using to against the Protected images is ArcFace model, it can be change in the Rank-N-T & Rank-N-UT Evaluation section.
